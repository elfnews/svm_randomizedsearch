# Suppor Vector Machine with Randomized Search
This is a diabetes case study. 
The following algorithms are used to analyze the data:
- RadomForestClassfier with a randomized search is used to tune the hyper parameters like max_depth, n_estimaters, etc.
- AdaBoostClassifier with a randomized search is used to tune the hyper parameters like learning_rate, n_estimaters, etc.
- Support Vector Machine with a randomized search is used to tune the hyper parameters of C & Kernel.

The analysis is plotted on graphs for display
